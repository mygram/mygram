          <h1>Transactions over SMS</h1>
          <p>Mygram allows you to:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Conduct transactions, not just send information:</strong> Mygram notifications are secure, authenticated links to active, rich content.</li>
              <li><strong>Replace complex APIs with email:</strong> Instead of grappling with complex SMS Gateway APIs, you simply send notifications to your users by email - they receive an SMS with an authenticated link to your content.</li>
              <li><strong>Send unlimited messages:</strong> You can send as many messages as you want -  we don’t charge you for outgoing messages. You are only charged a flat fee for each subscribed user.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h1>How does it work?</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>Your users subscribe to your service by SMSing your code (like ‘ROZ’) to <strong>87676 87676</strong>.</li>
            <li>An <strong>activation link</strong> is sent to the user as an SMS. Clicking it activates her account.</li>
            <li>To send notifications, you simply send an <strong>email</strong> to &lt;user phone number&gt;@mygram.in.</li>
            <li>The user receives an <strong>SMS</strong> with a link to your email.</li>
            <li>This link will <strong>only</strong> open on the user’s phone - nowhere else. Therefore, you can safely send submission forms and links (such as ‘Click to apply’) to complete transactions with your users through Mygram.</li>
          </ol>

        <section id="pricing">
          <h1>Pricing</h1>
          <p>You can send an <strong>unlimited</strong> number of messages to your users. You are only  charged <strong>₹10</strong> per subscribed user, per year.</p>
